# Data Engineering Cohort June 2025 (DE-2506-A)

Welcome to the June 2025 Data Engineering cohort! This page provides important information and resources for all trainees.

## Getting Started

- **Repository Links**:  
  Below are links to repositories you should fork to participate in demonstrations and hands-on activities.  

  > - [1. Tech Essentials SQL](https://github.com/de-2506-a/tech-essentials-sql)
  > - [2. Git Basics](https://github.com/de-2506-a/git-basics)
  > - [3. Python Basics](https://github.com/de-2506-a/python-basics)
  > - [4. Web Scraping](https://github.com/de-2506-a/web-scraping)

- **Instructions for Forking, Cloning Repositories and creating a new Branch**:  
  1. Click the link for each repository above.
  2. Click the **Fork** button (top right) to create your own copy.
  3. Once forked, click the **Code** button and copy the URL.
  4. Clone to your local machine using:  
     ```bash
     git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
     ```
  5. Create a branch for you to work on using:
     ```bash
     git switch -c <your-branch-name>
     ```
     This ensures that the `main` branch can receive updates more easily from the upstream.

- **How to Follow Along with Demonstrations**:  
  - Make sure you have forked and cloned all required repositories before the session.
  - Check for any setup instructions in each repo’s README.
  - As demonstrations proceed, commit your work to your fork.
  - If you get stuck, refer to the instructor’s repo or ask for help.
